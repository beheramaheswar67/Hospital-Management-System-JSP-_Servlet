## 🏁 Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beheramaheswar67/Hospital-Management-System-JSP-_Servlet.git
cd Hospital-Management-System-JSP-_Servlet
````

### 2. Setup MySQL Database

* Create a database (for example, `hospitaldb`).
* Import the SQL schema & sample data from `SQL/` folder.
* Update the database connection settings in your project (in configuration file or servlet utils) — e.g. URL, username, password, driver.

### 3. Configure Email (for OTP & notifications)

* Ensure SMTP settings (host, port, user, pass, SSL/TLS) are configured in your mail utility or properties.
* You may need to enable “less secure apps” or app-specific password if using Gmail SMTP.

### 4. Build & Deploy

* Use your IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / NetBeans) to add this project as a **Dynamic Web Project** (or equivalent).
* Add the required libraries (JDBC connector, JavaMail, Bootstrap, etc.) in `WEB-INF/lib`.
* Deploy to a servlet container (e.g. Apache Tomcat).

### 5. Run & Access

* Start your server (e.g. Tomcat).
* Access the application via browser:

  ```
  http://localhost:8080/YourAppContext/
  ```

## 👥 User Roles & Access

| Role             | Capabilities                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User/Patient** | Register, login, view doctors, book and manage appointments, reset password via OTP      |
| **Admin**        | Manage doctors (add/edit/remove), view all appointments, admin-level control over system |

---

## 🔐 Security & Validation

* Passwords should be hashed (e.g. using bcrypt or SHA-based hashing) before storing in DB.
* Input validation on both client and server side to prevent SQL injection, XSS, etc.
* Session management to ensure only authenticated users access certain pages.
* Email OTP for verification adds a layer of user identity validation.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements / To-Do

* Add more user roles (e.g. receptionist, lab technician)
* SMS / WhatsApp notifications for appointments
* Implement a calendar view for doctor schedules
* Enhance UI/UX (responsive design, better theming)
* Add report generation (PDFs, statistics)
* Integrate external APIs (lab tests, insurance, etc.)
